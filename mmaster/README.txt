
Tooling:
I used Python to implement my solution, and I did not need to import any libraries.  

Sources:
I only used the Haskell files (MonoTM.hs and MonoTMExamples.hs) for reference.  

Tests:
Throughout the project, I used a huge amount of print statements, but most of them 
were deleted to keep my code clean.  There are some tests in the main function that
are not commented out that test the functionality of each fuction and type.  

Implementation:
I used classes to make blueprints for TM's, Configs, Histories, and trans functions.  
I then wrote out each function that interacted with these classes, creating instances
to test things out along the way.  I thought the project pdf was very clear in describing
exactly how we were supposed to design a turing machine.  I would have liked to have
more freedom, but I am glad that instructions were so clear.  

Status:
I believe that my simulator is working as intended.
